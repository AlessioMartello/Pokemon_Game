# Pokemon_Game
The aim of this project is to create a GUI game clone of pokemon. 

Master branch is only the initial commit. Most up to date branch is mcvStructure

Current version of game is basic, takes you through one very simple battle. To play use the mcvStructure branch and run the game.py file. Navigate through th game by clicking the buttons on the GUI.

Current work is being done to refactor code so that v1 can be merged to master.
